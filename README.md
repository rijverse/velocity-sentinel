### Adding New Benchmarks

```javascript
// src/benchmarks/custom-benchmark.js
const { performance } = require('perf_hooks');

function customBenchmark() {
  const start = performance.now();
  
  // Your custom benchmark logic
  performCustomOperation();
  
  const end = performance.now();
  const duration = end - start;
  
  return {
    name: 'Custom Benchmark',
    duration: duration,
    operations: operationCount,
    throughput: operationCount / (duration / 1000)
  };
}

module.exports = { customBenchmark };
```

### Runner-Specific Configurations
